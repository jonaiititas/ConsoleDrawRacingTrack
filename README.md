## ConsoleDrawRacingTrack

Main variables to change in the main RacingTrack class:
* nNodes to change the number of red (controlable) nodes (currently at 15)
* nNodesSpline to change the number of points in path and boundary splines (currently at 150)
* fTrackWidth to change the width of the track (currently at 10)

There is the main .cpp file to run and a header .h file which contains the console engine.

It is possible to use Visual Studio IDE to run the code if you want to tinker with the variables. When you run the .cpp file, a console window should appear in which you draw the track. 

However, you can also just use the .exe file in the main directory to run the code without any IDE. To close and save the track to a .csv file press the red button at the bottom-right corner. Make sure to create a "data" folder in the directory you run the program to store the .csv files.
