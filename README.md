ConsoleDrawRacingTrack

Main variables to change in the main RacingTrack class:
* nNodes to change the number of red (controlable) nodes (currently at 15)
* nNodesSpline to change the number of points in path and boundary splines (currently at 150)
* fTrackWidth to change the width of the track (currently at 10)

There is the main .cpp file to run and a header .h file which contains the console engine.

I used Visual Studio IDE to compile to code. When you run the .cpp file, a console window should appear in which you draw the track. To close and save the track to a .csv file press the red button at the bottom-right corner.
