ConsoleDrawRacingTrack

Main variables to change in the OneLoneCoder_RacingLine class:
* nNodes to change the number of red (controlable) nodes (currently at 15)
* nNodesSpline to change the number of points in path and boundary splines (currently at 60)

There is the main .cpp file to run and a header .h file which contains the console engine.

I used Visual Studio IDE to compile to code. When you run the .cpp file, a console window should appear in which you draw the track. When you close the console it automatically creates a .csv file in the data folder.
